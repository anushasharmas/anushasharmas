# Project Decisions & Rationale

## Scheduling Strategy
- Support two modes:
  1. Long single-subject sessions
  2. Multiple subjects per day
- Avoid back-to-back difficult subjects to reduce cognitive fatigue.

## Design Philosophy
- Logic clarity > micro-optimizations.
- Decisions documented to make future debugging and refactoring easier.

## Future Considerations
- Difficulty tagging per subject.
- Energy-based scheduling.
