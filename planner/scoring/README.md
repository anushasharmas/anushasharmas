# Scoring

This module analyses the provided inputs and assigns a numerical score to
each subject or task based on factors such as difficulty, importance,
credits, and exam proximity.

The computed scores are used to simplify decision-making and enable efficient
and proportional allocation of available study time during scheduling.
