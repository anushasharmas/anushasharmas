# Scheduling Constraints

## Cognitive Constraints
- Difficult subjects must not be scheduled back-to-back.
- High-focus subjects should be placed earlier in the day where possible.

## Time Constraints
- Daily study time is capped to avoid burnout.
- Long sessions should be optional, not forced.

## User Constraints
- User preference overrides default distribution when conflicts arise.
- Flexibility is prioritized over perfect optimization.

## Non-Goals
- This project does not aim to find a globally optimal schedule.
- Simplicity and explainability are preferred over complex heuristics.
