# Scheduling Invariants

These invariants must always hold true regardless of scheduling mode or user preference.

## Invariants
1. No subject with difficulty level "hard" may be scheduled consecutively.
2. Total allocated study time must not exceed the user-defined daily limit.
3. A subject cannot appear more times than its required unit count.
4. Rest or buffer time must exist between long sessions.

## Enforcement
- Invariants should be checked after schedule generation.
- Violations must raise explicit errors or warnings.
