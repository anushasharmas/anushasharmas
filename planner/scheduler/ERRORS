# Error Handling & Failure Modes

This document describes known error cases and how the scheduler should respond.

## Configuration Errors
- Missing subject difficulty tags
- Invalid or negative time allocations
- Total required units exceeding available days

## Runtime Errors
- Invariant violations after schedule generation
- Conflicting user constraints that cannot be satisfied

## Handling Strategy
- Prefer explicit exceptions over silent correction
- Provide actionable error messages to the user
- Fail fast when core constraints are violated

## Future Improvements
- Structured error types
- User-facing explanations for conflicts
